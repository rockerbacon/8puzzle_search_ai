All the code presented was implemented for a college work at Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro.
The objective was to implement an AI that could solve the 8 puzzle using breadth first, A*, greedy and uniform cost searches within a time limit.

Program call: python3 main.py <file with puzzle> <method> <time limit in seconds>
For the method argument use:

	BFS for Breadth first search

	A* for A* search

	GREEDY for greedy search

	UNIFORM for uniform cost search
